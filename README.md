**Product Validation Tool** 🛡️

**Abstract** 🚀

Guarding consumers against counterfeit products is crucial. This project, built using Truffle, Ganache, and blockchain technology, offers a robust solution to verify product authenticity. Utilizing smart contracts and decentralized technology, it ensures that genuine products are easily distinguishable from fake ones.

**Setup Process** 🛠️

1. **Clone the Project** 📦
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/A4ANK/Fake-Product-Identification.git
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages** 📦
   Open your terminal, navigate to the project folder, and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Compile Contract Source Files** ⚙️
   Compile the smart contract source files using Truffle:
   ```bash
   truffle compile
   ```

4. **Setup Local Blockchain** ⛓️
   - Open Ganache and create a new workspace.
   - Add `truffle-config.js` from your project to the workspace.
   - Change the port in server settings to 8545 (same as port in `truffle-config.js`).

5. **Configure MetaMask** 🦊
   - In your Chromium-based browser (e.g., Chrome), open MetaMask.
   - Add a new test network with these settings:
     - NETWORK ID: 5777 (from Ganache Server settings)
     - RPC SERVER: HTTP://127.0.0.1:8545 (from Ganache Server settings)
     - CHAIN CODE: 1337

6. **Import Accounts from Ganache** 💼
   - Get a private key from any account available in Ganache's local blockchain.
   - Import this account into MetaMask.

7. **Migrate Contracts** 🚀
   In your terminal, run the following commands:
   ```bash
   truffle migrate
   ```

8. **Start the Server** 🌐
   Run the server to open the homepage (index.html) in your default browser:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

9. **Connect to Local Blockchain** 🔗
   - Log in to MetaMask and connect the added account to the local blockchain (i.e., localhost:3000).

10. **Interact with the Website** 💻
   Explore the website and leverage the power of blockchain to identify fake products effectively.
